        <body> <p>I am a civil engineer looking to expand my skills and work towards a role in software development.
            I have been a civil engineer for 8 years now and I have a BEng in Civil Engineering with a first class honours.</p>
            
            <p>I found the Manchester Codes Course through Google, and coding is something that has interested me for some time.
                I have attempted some self taught work, but found direction difficult, essentially not knowing where to start!
                This bootcamp should give me the structure and guidance required to learn coding properly.</p>
